        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: January 24, 2026</strong></p>

        <p>Welcome to KnoxCalls Night Watch. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of
            Service ("Terms"). Please read them carefully.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By signing up for, accessing, or using the Night Watch service ("Service"), you agree to comply with and be
            bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Services Provided</h2>
        <p>Night Watch provides AI-powered after-hours call answering, triage, and emergency dispatch services for
            contractors and businesses. We act as an agent for your business to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Answer incoming calls using AI technology</li>
            <li>Screen and classify calls based on urgency</li>
            <li>Dispatch emergency notifications to designated contacts</li>
            <li>Provide call logs, recordings, and transcripts</li>
            <li>Filter spam and robocalls</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.1 AI Service Limitations</h3>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Our Service uses artificial intelligence technology. While we strive for
                accuracy, the AI may occasionally misclassify calls or fail to understand complex situations. Night
                Watch is a screening and notification tool, not a replacement for professional judgment. You remain
                responsible for responding to emergencies and managing your business operations.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. SMS/Text Messaging Terms</h2>
        <p>By opting in to our service (via web form or written agreement), you agree to receive SMS messages from
            KnoxCalls regarding your account and dispatch alerts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Program Description:</strong> We send alerts for emergency calls, service updates, and account
                notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Message Frequency:</strong> Message frequency varies based on your call volume and account
                activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Message and data rates may apply.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can cancel the SMS service at any time. Just text "STOP" to the number.
                After you send the SMS message "STOP" to us, we will send you an SMS message to confirm that you have
                been unsubscribed. After this, you will no longer receive SMS messages from us. If you want to join
                again, just sign up as you did the first time and we will start sending SMS messages to you again.</li>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> If you are experiencing issues with the messaging program you can reply with
                the keyword HELP for more assistance, or you can get help directly at info@knoxcalls.com.</li>
            <li><strong>Carriers:</strong> Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.</li>
        </ul>
